Hello Nicolas!

Subject: Request for Shortfall Letters (2022=E2=80=932024)

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to formally request the Shortfall Letters for the years 2022,
2023, and 2024, including the cumulative total. I have been attempting to
obtain this information for several weeks now; however, I have yet to
receive a response to my previous emails.

I kindly ask for your collaboration in providing these documents as soon as
possible, as they are essential for the proper management of my file.

Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. I remain available
should you require any additional information.

Best regards,
C=C3=A9dric Leboeuf

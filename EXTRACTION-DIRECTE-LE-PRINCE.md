# 📜 EXTRACTION DIRECTE - LE PRINCE DE MACHIAVEL
## Passages Essentiels pour Comprendre Jerome

---

# CHAPITRE 15 : LA REALITE VS L'IDEAL

> **"How one lives is so far distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much that is evil."**

### 🎯 APPLICATION A JEROME
- Jerome a compris que la morale ne protege pas
- Il agit selon ce qui MARCHE, pas selon ce qui est "juste"
- Tu lui as envoye l'email sur l'Esprit de Verite - il l'a IGNORE

> **"Hence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity."**

**TRADUCTION JEROME:** "Je sais faire le mal quand c'est necessaire pour prendre ta position."

---

# CHAPITRE 17 : AIME OU CRAINT?

> **"Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, IT IS MUCH SAFER TO BE FEARED THAN LOVED."**

### 🎯 APPLICATION A JEROME
- Jerome ne cherche PAS ton amitie
- Il construit une position de FORCE
- Son but: que tu aies PEUR de le perdre

> **"Men are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children... when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you."**

**TRADUCTION JEROME:** "Tant que tu me donnes ce que je veux, je suis ton 'partenaire'. Mais quand je veux plus, je me retourne contre toi."

> **"Men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage."**

**CE QUE CA VEUT DIRE:** Jerome peut te blesser PARCE QUE tu es "gentil". Ta gentillesse n'est pas une protection.

---

# CHAPITRE 18 : LA DUPLICITE (LE PLUS IMPORTANT)

> **"A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose THE FOX AND THE LION; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves. Therefore, IT IS NECESSARY TO BE A FOX TO DISCOVER THE SNARES AND A LION TO TERRIFY THE WOLVES."**

### 🎯 JEROME = LE RENARD

| MOMENT | RENARD OU LION? |
|--------|-----------------|
| "Es-tu a l'aise qu'on fasse un switch?" | 🦊 RENARD - Question piegeuse |
| "C'est pas une attaque" | 🦊 RENARD - Dissimulation |
| "C'est moi qui l'ai trouve" | 🦁 LION - Affirmation de force |
| "Je developpe tout" | 🦁 LION - Intimidation |
| Contacts Rocket Hammer | 🦊 RENARD - Construction d'alternatives |

> **"Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer."**

**TRADUCTION DIRECTE:** "Si garder ma promesse me nuit, je ne la garde pas."

> **"If men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them."**

**CE QUE JEROME PENSE:** "Tu ne garderais pas tes promesses si ca te convenait, alors pourquoi je garderais les miennes?"

---

# LE PASSAGE LE PLUS REVELATEUR

> **"But it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic, and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived."**

### 🎯 ANALYSE CRITIQUE

| ELEMENT | APPLICATION JEROME |
|---------|-------------------|
| "Disguise" | "C'est pas une attaque" |
| "Pretender" | "J'ai essaye de pousser pour egal" |
| "Dissembler" | "Je joue pas de games" |
| "Men are simple" | Il compte sur ta confiance |
| "Subject to present necessities" | Il attend le bon moment |

> **"Alexander the Sixth did nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he always found victims."**

**MESSAGE:** Les deceveurs trouvent TOUJOURS des victimes. La question: es-tu une victime potentielle?

---

# CHAPITRE 19 : EVITER LA HAINE ET LE MEPRIS

> **"It makes him hated above all things to be rapacious, and to be a violator of the property."**

### 🎯 APPLICATION A JEROME
- Jerome ne veut PAS etre hai ouvertement
- Il veut TES PARTS sans paraitre "rapace"
- D'ou la formulation "switch" au lieu de "je veux plus"

> **"Therefore, a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers."**

**CE QUE JEROME FAIT:**
1. **De l'interieur:** Te convaincre de donner tes parts
2. **De l'exterieur:** Construire ses contacts (Rocket Hammer, etc.)

> **"For he who conspires against a prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have the courage to take such a course."**

**TRADUCTION:** Jerome agit parce qu'il pense que ca VA BIEN FINIR pour lui.

---

# CHAPITRE 21 : GAGNER LA REPUTATION

> **"Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and setting a fine example."**

### 🎯 APPLICATION A JEROME
- "C'est MOI qui l'ai trouve" = entreprise
- "Je DEVELOPPE tout" = exemple
- Contacts Rocket Hammer = reputation

> **"A prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a downright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he declares himself in favour of one party against the other."**

**STRATEGIE DE JEROME:** Il joue ENTRE les deux. Ni ami ni ennemi clair. Zone grise.

---

# CHAPITRE 22 : JUGER LES SERVITEURS

> **"When you see the servant thinking more of his own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you ever be able to trust him."**

### 🚨 CE PASSAGE DECRIT EXACTEMENT JEROME

| CRITERE MACHIAVEL | JEROME |
|-------------------|--------|
| "Thinking of his own interests" | Switch pour SES parts |
| "Seeking his own profit" | 23% pour lui |
| "Never make a good servant" | **"Partenaire" mais pas loyal** |

> **"Because he who has the state of another in his hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince."**

**VERDICT:** Jerome pense a LUI, pas a l'entreprise commune.

---

# CHAPITRE 23 : EVITER LES FLATTEURS

> **"Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests, and the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them."**

### 🎯 APPLICATION
- Jerome te conseille-t-il pour TON bien?
- Ou pour SON interet?
- Ses "conseils" servent-ils l'entreprise ou sa position?

---

# CHAPITRE 25 : LA FORTUNE

> **"I believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful."**

### 🎯 APPLICATION
- Jerome ADAPTE ses tactiques
- Il attend le BON MOMENT (projet Dr Grenier)
- Il exploite les CIRCONSTANCES

> **"But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to know how to accommodate himself to the change."**

**TA FORCE POTENTIELLE:** Tu peux changer. Lui aussi. Mais QUI change plus vite?

> **"Fortune is a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and ill-use her; and it is seen that SHE ALLOWS HERSELF TO BE MASTERED BY THE ADVENTUROUS rather than by those who go to work more coldly."**

**MESSAGE FINAL:** L'audace gagne. La passivite perd.

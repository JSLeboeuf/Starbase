---

## 🎯 TECHNIQUES DU NARCISSIQUE IDENTIFIEES

### 1. OVERVALUES SELF, DEVALUES OTHERS
> "Narcissistic personalities tend to see everyone else as either marginal or inferior. They become masters at putting others down to elevate themselves"

**Jerome fait ca quand:** Il minimise ta contribution ("C'est MOI qui developpe tout")

### 2. TAKES SHORTCUTS, BENDS RULES
> "Because they feel entitled, narcissistic personalities may feel they don't have to work as hard as others, that they can take shortcuts"

**Jerome fait ca quand:** Il veut changer les regles APRES que le deal est fait

### 3. NEEDS TO CONTROL
> "Narcissists often seek positions where they can control others"

**Jerome fait ca quand:** Il se positionne comme "indispensable" pour Riviere-Baudette

### 4. CONDITIONAL LOVE
> "For them, love is conditional or comes with strings attached... 'I will do this for you, but I expect certain things in return'"

**Jerome fait ca quand:** Quid pro quo implicite - "Je developpe, donc je merite plus"

---

## ⚠️ EFFET SUR TOI (Selon FBI)

> "Narcissists leave you feeling molded, manipulated, maneuvered, or even empty and used"

> "They wear on you. Narcissistic personalities see your needs, wants, or desires only as distractions or as obstacles to their own"

> "Every person who has lived or worked with a narcissistic personality has been forbidden somehow or another to flourish"

---

# PARTIE 2: POLITICAL PONEROLOGY (Lobaczewski)

## La Science du Mal - Ponerologie

### Le Psychopathe Essentiel

> "The psychopath recognizes no flaw in his psyche, no need for change"

> "What differentiates a sociopath who lives off the labors of others from a contemporary robber baron is nothing more than social status, drive, intellect, blood lust, or simple opportunity"

### Le Masque de Sante

> "Likeable, Charming, Intelligent, Alert, Impressive, Confidence-inspiring, A great success with the ladies - This is how Cleckley described most of his subjects"

> "The smooth self-assurance acts as an almost supernatural magnet to normal people"

### L'Argument Legal - Comment les Psychopathes Gagnent

> "The legal argument amounts to little more than the one who is the slickest at using the structure for convincing a group of people of something, is the one who is believed"

> "The truth, when twisted by good liars, can always make an innocent person look bad, especially if the innocent person is honest and admits his mistakes"

**APPLICATION JEROME:** Sa "logique" du switch semble raisonnable superficiellement. C'est exactement la technique decrite.

### Le Deficit Affectif

> "The psychopath suffers from profound and incurable affective deficit. If he really feels anything at all, they are emotions of only the shallowest kind"

> "What to others would be a horror or a disaster is to him merely a fleeting inconvenience"

---

## 🔴 CONCEPT CLE: LA PREDATION

> "In short, the psychopath is a PREDATOR. Just as an animal predator will adopt all kinds of stealthy functions to stalk their prey, cut them out of the herd, get close to them, and reduce their resistance, so does the psychopath construct all kinds of elaborate camouflage composed of words and appearances - lies and manipulations - to 'assimilate' their prey"

**APPLICATION:** Jerome te "coupe du troupeau" en se presentant comme ton seul partenaire viable pour Riviere-Baudette.

---

## 🎭 CE QUE LE PSYCHOPATHE OBTIENT

> "What does the psychopath really get from their victims? It's easy to see what they are after when they lie and manipulate for money or material goods or power. But in many instances, such as love relationships or faked friendships, it is not so easy to see"

> "It seems to be that the psychopath enjoys making others suffer. Just as normal humans enjoy seeing other people happy, the psychopath enjoys the exact opposite"

> "Many people who experience interactions with psychopaths report feeling 'drained' and confused and often subsequently experience deteriorating health"

---

# PARTIE 3: THE RAPE OF THE MIND (Meerloo)

## Le Lavage de Cerveau et le Menticide

### Conditionnement de Masse par la Parole

> "He who dictates and formulates the words and phrases we use, he who is master of the press and radio, is master of the mind"

> "Such is the Pavlovian device: repeat mechanically your assumptions and suggestions, diminish the opportunity of communicating dissent and opposition"

**APPLICATION:** Jerome repete sa "logique" constamment pour qu'elle devienne "vraie"

### Le Besoin d'Effondrement

> "Every individual has two opposing needs: the need to be independent, to be oneself; and the need NOT to be oneself, NOT to be anybody at all, NOT to resist mental pressure"

> "The wish to collapse, to let go, to be not there, becomes almost irresistible"

### Isolation et Conditionnement

> "Pavlov formulated his findings into a general rule in which the speed of learning is positively correlated with quiet and isolation. The totalitarians have followed this rule"

**APPLICATION:** Jerome t'isole du reste du groupe en se positionnant comme l'unique developpeur.

### Le Chantage par la Culpabilite

> "The strategy of arousing guilt is the mother's oldest tool for gaining dominance over her children's souls"

> "Deep within all of us lie hidden feelings of guilt, unconscious guilt, which can be brought to the surface under extreme stress"

**APPLICATION:** Jerome utilise ta culpabilite potentielle ("tu ne developpes pas assez") pour te manipuler.

---

## 🧠 MECANISMES DE DEFENSE CONTRE LE MENTICIDE

### Ce Qui Protege

> "People who know what to expect under conditions of mental pressure can develop a 'perceptual defense' which protects them from being influenced"

> "The more familiar people are with the concepts of thought control and menticide, the more they understand the nature of the propaganda barrage directed against them, the more inner resistance they can put up"

### L'Importance de la Foi

> "Those with a rigid, simple belief were better able to withstand the continual barrage against their minds than were the flexible, sophisticated ones, full of doubt and inner conflicts"

# PARTIE 6: CONFESSIONS OF A SOCIOPATH (M.E. Thomas)

## Vue de l'Interieur - Comment un Sociopathe Pense

### Definition par une Sociopathe

> "I am generally free of entangling and irrational emotions, I am strategic and canny, I am intelligent and confident and charming, but I also struggle to react appropriately to other people's confusing and emotion-driven social cues"

### Le Charme Superficiel

> "I have the kind of smile that is common among television show characters and rare in real life, perfect in its sparkly-teeth dimensions and ability to express pleasant invitation"

> "I'm the sort of date you would love to bring to your ex's wedding. Fun, exciting, the perfect office escort—your boss's wife has never met anyone quite so charming"

### Le Regard Predateur

> "Perhaps the most noticeable aspect of my confidence is the way I sustain eye contact. Some people have called it a 'predator stare'"

> "Sustained eye contact can seem hostile... Our failure to look away politely is often perceived as being confident, aggressive, seductive, or predatory"

### Sur la Manipulation

> "Ever find yourself using that charm and confidence to get people to do things for you that they otherwise wouldn't? Some might call it manipulation, but I like to consider it simply using what God gave me"

> "The word manipulation is so ugly. It's what people say to disavow their own choices"

> "Manipulation is just fulfilling an exchange. People want a particular thing—to please you, to feel wanted or needed, to be seen as a good person—and manipulation is just a quick and dirty way to get both people something they want"

### L'Arbitrage Social

> "One guy wants to sell a car for $5,000, the second wants to buy it for $10,000. I am aware of the two but neither is aware of the other. I buy the car for $5,000, sell it to the second guy for $10,000, and I make $5,000. It's called arbitrage... We all get what we want, as long as the two never connect the dots"

**APPLICATION JEROME:** Il fait de l'arbitrage entre toi et les projets. Il se positionne comme intermediaire indispensable.

### Succes Corporatif et Sociopathie

> "Dr. Robert Hare believes that a sociopath is four times more likely to be at the top of the corporate ladder than in the janitor's closet, due to the close match between the personality traits of sociopaths and the unusual demands of high-powered jobs"

> "Robert Hare says that the biggest tip-off to identifying a 'successful sociopath' is a 'predatory spirit,' just the kind that businesses seem to love"

### Les Histoires Qu'ils Se Racontent

> "Sociopaths don't include elements of guilt or moral responsibility in their mental stories, only self-interest and self-preservation. I don't assign moral values to my choices, just cost-benefit"

> "I like to imagine that I have 'ruined people' or seduced someone to the point of being irreparably mine. The stories I tell myself to explain my actions are self-aggrandizing"

> "The only situation in which I may feel shame or embarrassment is when I have been outplayed"

**APPLICATION:** Jerome se raconte qu'il est le "vrai developpeur", qu'il "merite plus". C'est son narratif interne.

### Le Masque Social

> "I mimic the way other people interact with others, not to trick them, but so I can hide among them"

> "I hide because I fear that if I am discovered there will be unpredictable negative consequences"

> "There has always been something foreign seeming about me... 'People, no matter how stupid, can't put their finger on it, but somehow know I'm not quite right'"
